### Spatially Dependent Convolution ([Felix Wechsler](https://mailhide.io/e/scBJzLBn))
Modern image devices tend to use cheaper hardware but more sophisticated algorithms.
Often, the forward imaging process cannot described as a convolution any longer.
Hence, a spatially dependent deconvolution routine is needed.
Aim of this project is to develop a prototype for the general problem of spatially dependent deconvolution.
Recent publications strongly point to the usage of neural nets for the reconstruction.
The work should be realized favorably in Julia Lang.
