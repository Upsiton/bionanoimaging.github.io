### Spatially Dependent Convolution ([Felix Wechsler](https://mailhide.io/e/scBJzLBn))
Modern image devices tend to have cheaper hardware but more sophisticated algorithms.
Often, the forward imaging process cannot described as a convolution longer.
Hence, a spatially dependent deconvolution routine is needed.
Aim of this project is to develop a prototype for the general problem of spatially dependent convolution.
Recent publications strongly point to the usage of neural nets for the reconstruction.
