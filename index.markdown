title: Bio-Nanoimaging Group
---
We are a research group located at the [Leibniz Institute of Photonics Technology (IPHT)](https://www.leibniz-ipht.de/en/homepage/) and the [Institute of Physical Chemistry](https://www.ipc.uni-jena.de/en/research-groups/heintzmann-group) in Jena, Germany.
The group is led by Rainer Heintzmann.

# Our Mission

Our workgroup focuses both on developing novel methods and devices for light microscopy as well as on improving established techniques. 
We work on computational algorithms enhancing properties such as resolution of microscopes using structured illumination (SIM).

We aim to support researchers around the world with imaging devices which are easy replicate. This includes low-cost (microscopic) imaging devices, but also image processing algorithms. See the GitHub page of [UC2](youseetoo.org) for further reference.

Recently, we work more and more on open source software regarding microscopy image processing in [Julia Lang](https://julialang.org/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/?q=&type=all&language=&sort=stargazers).
